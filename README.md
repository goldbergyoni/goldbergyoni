# Yoni Goldberg - Developer, Architect, Consultant

## About me in 2 paragraphs

I stumbled into the world of programming by accident, discovering a programming book at my parents' house. It was 9 PM when I began flipping through its pages, and suddenly, sun rays were streaming through the window‚Äîmorning had arrived. I was amazed by this incredible science, feeling like Alice in Wonderland. Ever since then, I've been in love with this. I code, consult, write about it, and speak about it worldwide. My blog has welcomed over 7 million visitors, and my GitHub repositories have earned 126,000 stars.

If there's one skill I've honed over the years, it's coding and designing with SIMPLICITY in mind. I always strive to find the sweet spot between robustness and simplicity, considering it one of the finest arts of our profession. While I'm curious about many aspects of software, it's Testing that I love a little more. I've had the privilege to work with over 40 organizations worldwide, including some giant companies you probably know, enhancing their testing processes. I'm a big fan of the new testing paradigm‚Äîthe testing diamond‚Äîand believe that tests should blend seamlessly and effortlessly into developers' workflows.

## Hire me

Want to work together? yay ü•≥. Here are the 3 main services that I provide:

### Coding for you

My bread and butter activity. I code primarily in JavaScript (Node.js, Rect) and Python, though happy to code in other modern languages like Go and Kotlin. What makes me a reliable developer? I strive for simple code. Many others say this, but me? Even medium-level code complexity makes me sweat with unease in my chair. I fear complexity! This drives me to write highly standardized code,  avoiding reinventing new wheels, and just keeping it lean and nimble

### Testing enhancements and workshop for your team

I worked with dozens of org worldwide on boosting their testing skills, using various training methods including a comprehensive workshop. [See more details here including a short summary video](https://testjavascript.com/elevate-your-org-testing-game)

### Architecture planning and consulting

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to plan challenging systems with large organizations (see customer list below). I remember once a customer asked me to plan a big system with a team of developers. After weeks of hard work, we came up with a skeleton. Some stakeholders were disappointed to see that the skeleton was only 300 lines of code and contained very few patterns and layers. "What took you so long?" they wondered.

"We carefully chose valuable popular tools to do most of the work for us and removed any unnecessary overhead," we explained. For me, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Fast forward a year, and most of the organization learned to appreciate that flat and nimble architecture that everyone can understand in hours, not weeks
